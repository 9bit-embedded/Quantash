## About the project

Quantash (Quantum Agile Security Hardware) is an open-source, hardware-optimized Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Security Element IP core designed for seamless integration into ASIC and FPGA platforms.
The project combines a compact open-source RISC-V processor with custom hardware accelerators to efficiently offload and execute the computationally intensive operations of modern PQC algorithms on resource-constrained embedded devices.

## Documentation

Project is currently in active development, more comprenhensive documentation will be added soon. Currently available documents:
